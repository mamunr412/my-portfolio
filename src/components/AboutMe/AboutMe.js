              I am a Web Developer having a solid understanding of front-end
              technology mainly focused on React. Now letâ€™s talk about how I
              choose web development as my career. In the early year of my
              graduation, I found interest in coding. I learn DSA and start
              doing problem-solving on many online platforms. As a beginner, I
              was trying various programming languages like C, C++, Java,
              Python, JavaScript, and a couple of technology. After 3 years in
              2019, I became a moderator of my departmental programming club
              called Euclid Programming Club. I helped many of my university
              juniors to learn to code. It was really fun and actually helping
              others is the best way of learning. One day, a friend of mine came
              to show me a problem with his website project that he was working
              on. It was PHP and I have no idea about PHP. Then I was thinking
              that as I know JavaScript and it is used to build websites so let
              try it out. I start learning React and it was quite fun and easy.
              I am a motivated person but I love to hear from people who
              motivated others. I love to talk about technology and try to learn
              more. I believe learning means living.
